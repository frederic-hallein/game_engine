# game_engine

Custom 2D game engine.

# How to run

Step 1: Download all the files. \
Step 2: Via a terminal go to the game_engine directory. \
Step 3: Enter the "mingw32-make -f makefile" command. This should create a main.exe in the same folder. \
Step 4: Run main.exe. 

# How to play

Move left with A and move right with D (WASD key configuration). Jump and double jump with SPACE.

# Troubleshooting

If the command from Step 3 is not recognized, try to install the mingw-get-setup from the website: \
[https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) and install the mingw32-make package in the MinGW Installation Manager. \
After that, make sure you have "mingw32\bin" in your PATH.
